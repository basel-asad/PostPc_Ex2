theoratical question:
	Saying we want to add a cool feature - button "x" to run multiplication.
	What code do we need to change/add/remove to support this feature?
	Which tests can we run on the calculator? On the activity? On the app?

	
	1) we would need to add the button with X in it to the UI.
	2) 'input_orders' in "SimpleCalculatorImpl" should be modified to include "X" as well .
	3) 'calculate' in "SimpleCalculatorImpl" needs to be modified to support multiplication.
	4) 'insertMultiply' needs to be added to "SimpleCalculatorImpl".
	
	5) in MainActivity inside 'define_buttons' the multiplication button needs to be addressed as well (defined).
	
	6) tests: 
		1) testing if clicking the button calls the function "insertMultiply". (using mockito)
		2) trying out various flow tests, to see that the multiplication actully works. (button variable needs to be add at the top of 'AppFlowTest')
